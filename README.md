## What is This?
This repository is a collection of my findings from a research project I undertook during the spring of 2021. The research's main objective is to determine whether Fog Computing can lead to an improvement in QoS over Cloud Computing. This question's scope is vast; therefore, I have limited it to the specific use case of vehicles. I have used PureEdgeSim to test fog computing in "real-world" scenarios.
